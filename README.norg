* Neovim Configuration
** Informations
	 This configuration is based on [ https://nvchad.com/ ]( NvChad ). 

	 I have added some plugins and changed some settings for Go, Python, NodeJS and PHP development.

	 I Also added a note taking plugin called [ https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg ]( Neorg ).

	 It contains plugins for ChatGPT And Copilot.

** Installation
	 Some plugins require some external dependencies like ripgrep and lazygit.

	 In case you didl't have Neovim installed, you can install it with the following command:

	 ``` bash
	 ./install.sh
	 ```
