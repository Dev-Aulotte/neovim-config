# Neovim Configuration

## Informations

This configuration is based on [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/).

I have added some plugins and changed some settings for Go, Python, NodeJS and PHP development.

I Also added a note taking plugin called [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg).

It contains plugins for ChatGPT And Copilot.

## Installation

Some plugins require some external dependencies like ripgrep and lazygit.

In case you didl't have Neovim installed, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
./install.sh
```
